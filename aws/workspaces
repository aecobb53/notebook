# AWS Workspaces

## General

Workspaces integrate easilly but are a lot of work to set up. They also very durastickly depending on if it is for production or testing. 

Offers end to end security. 

## Applications

WorkSpaces - Desktops
WorkDocs - Filestorage
WorkMail - Hosted email
AppStream 2.0 - Streaming of selected application in a browser

Workspaces are your typicle vertual desktop but are designed to run Windows applications (or linux). AppStream 2.0 is designed to only run a browser app but is specilized to do that. 

> Because WorkSpaces are either pay monthly or hourly they might be tailored to be temporary work stations :shrug:

## AppStream

AppStream has stacks which are the individual instances of something. The fleets are a collection of stacks. 

It might be able to stream an IDE.

## WorkSpaces

WorkSpace bundles are the "hardware" associated with the station. 

Setting up a workspace can take 30-60 minutes. 

Has snapshots.

### Directories

You can have simple, full, or a connected directory strucutre. Most use the full (hosted) directory or connected directories. 

Can create an image from a running workspace (could be very useful as a base image for different groups of people)

It can be hard to package your own applications so take the time required to make sure you do it correctly from Amazon's documentation. 




## testing
