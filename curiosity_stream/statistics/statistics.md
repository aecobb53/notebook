There are two different definitions of the word `statistics`. 
    - The field of statistics and the practice of collecting
    - The facts and summaries of data

`Proxy`: is something thats _related_ to what were trying to measure but _not actually_ what were trying to measure.

In an example of trying to figure out why people eat fast food, you would need to study how much but also which days. This is important because there are many possible influencing factors.

`Descriptive Statistics`: describe what the data shows. they include things like where the middle of the data is. Its known as "measures of central tendency" and "how spread out the data are"
    - For example, count every taffy color in a candy bin
`Inferential Statistics`: Allow us to make conclusions beyond the data we have in hand.
    - For example, use descriptive statistics to count a small portion and infer what the rest of the bin has
