## Lists

There are three types of lists:

1. Number

2. Listed

    - With indent
  
- Regular

- Listed

    - With indent

- \-

* \*

> Note: Three indent spaces are required for numbered lists, but only two for non-numbered


![indent_example](image_dir/nested-list-alignment.png)

```md
1. Number

2. Listed

   - With indent
    
- Regular

- Listed

  - With indent

- \-

* \*
```

- [ ] Unchecked

- [x] Checked

```md
- [ ] Unchecked

- [x] Checked
```

The numbered lists will order all numbers in order not in the order see in the markdown. 
Basickly, if you switch lines around you dont have to update the numbers:

1. one
3. three
2. two

```
1. one
3. three
2. two
```

## Tables

| Style | Example | Syntax |
| ----- | ------- | ------ |
| Italic | *This is italic* | \*This is italic\* or \_This is italic\_ |
| Bold | **This is bold** | \**This is bold\** or \__This is bold\__ |
| Bold-Italic | ***This is bold-italic*** | \*\*\*This is bold-italic\*\*\* or \_\_\_This is bold-italic\_\_\_ |
| Strikethrough | ~This is sticken~ | \~This is sticken\~ or \~\~This is sticken\~\~ |


```md
| Style | Example | Syntax |
| ----- | ------- | ------ |
| Italic | *This is italic* | \*This is italic\* or \_This is italic\_ |

| Strikethrough | ~This is sticken~ | \~This is sticken\~ or \~\~This is sticken\~\~ |
```

> Note: You can get away with only placing three `-`for the second row. 
You can also add white space so that the file is easier to read.

## Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.
